= 15. Use command query separation to contracts module

Date: 2023-05-28

== Problem
Based on our findings, we have identified that the contracts module is likely to experience significant growth in business logic. 
Our estimations indicate that there will be a higher frequency of write operations compared to read operations in this module.

== Decision
To address this, our objective is to separate the write and read processes in order to mitigate complexity and streamline the system.
To implement command query separation (CQS), we have chosen to use the MediatR library, which provides a quick way to introduce this separation. 
MediatR is a popular library in the .NET ecosystem that helps in implementing the Mediator pattern, which is commonly used to decouple components in an application.

== Consequences
- Additional layer and reduced complexity.
- Clear responsibilities for write and read processes.
- Lays the foundation for a potential future transition to full CQRS architecture.
- Independent optimization of write and read operations.
- Ability to leverage different technologies for write and read processes.
- Clear division of responsibilities promotes smoother collaboration among developers.
- Simplifies comprehension of code logic and behavior for write and read processes.
- MediatR introduces some overhead to performance, but it is an acceptable trade-off.
- The module entry level is increased as a result of applying the new pattern.
