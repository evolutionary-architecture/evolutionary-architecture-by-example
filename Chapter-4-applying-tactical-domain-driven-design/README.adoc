== Case

=== Overview

In chapter 3, we had to find a way to handle the extreme growth of one of our modules - _Contracts_. Based on concrete factors, the decision was to:

- Extract a separate microservice from the modular monolith for _Contracts_
- Introduce an external component - RabbitMQ - to handle communication between modules and extracted microservice
- Extract building blocks to a separate solution that is built as a NuGet package and reuse it in both modular monolith and microservice

For several weeks, this solution worked as a charm. Traffic was handled without any issues in the area that had to scale (Contracts). However, at some point, our business came to us and asked us to change how our contracts were signed, and additionally, new requirements appeared. Based on that. we spotted that our _Contracts_ module is becoming more and more complex. That's not a big deal - we thought. In previous chapters, we prepared for it as there was a chance that this area would grow over time. 

NOTE: In this step we are going to focus on tactical Domain-Driven Design. As business logic grows and become more complex, it makes sense to think about Domain Model. Please note, that it requires a change in a way of thinking and might give the impression of something very complicated at first. Nevertheless, in long run, it will make this module easier to extend and maintain without having to deal with spaghetti code.

IMPORTANT: It makes no sense to think about the Domain Model in typical CRUD modules or those based on querying, e.g., reports. You do not need to apply the same patterns in all modules - such behavior is a typical anti-pattern. Choose a matching solution based on your needs, not someone else solutions.

=== Requirements

This time our requirements changed. There is another behavior on contracts:

1. Contracts can still be prepared and signed but does not in itself have the force of law.
2. After the contract is signed there is a new object called _BindingContract_. Such a contract has the force of law and binds the customer to a contract with us.
3. After 3 months, at anytime, customer can terminate _BindingContract_ without penalty.
4. It is possible to create an _Annex_ to the existing _BindingContract_. This way, customer can get extend the contract for another year without signing a new _Contract_.

=== Main assumptions

The assumptions remain unchanged to keep the environment comparable to the previous step.

== How to Run?

=== Requirements
- .NET SDK
- PostgresSQL
- Docker

=== How to get .NET SDK?

To run the `Fitnet` application, you will need to have the recent `.NET SDK` installed on your computer.
Click link:https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download[here] 
to download it from the official Microsoft website.

=== Run locally

The `Fitnet` application requires `Docker` to run properly.

There are only 5 steps you need to start the application:

1. Create you own personal access token in Github (it is needed to be able to download our GH Packages for `Common`). Instruction how to do it you can find https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-create-a-personal-access-token-for-github-access[here]. Your PAT must have only one value of `read:packages`. Note the token somewhere as it won't be possible to read it again.
2. Go to `Contracts\Src` folder and edit `Dockerfile`. You must change `your_username` and `your_personal_access_token` to your own values (your GH username and PAT that you generated in Step 1). Repeat the step for `ModularMonolith\Src`.
3. Make sure that you go back to `root` directory of Chapter 3. 
4. Run `docker-compose build` to build the image of the application.
5. Run `docker-compose up` to start the application. In the meantime it will also start Postgres inside container.

The `Fitnet``modular monolith application runs on port `:8080`. Please navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser or http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html to explore the API.

The `Contracts` microservice runs on port `:8081`. Please navigate to http://localhost:8081 in your browser or http://localhost:8081/swagger/index.html to explore the API.

That's it! You should now be able to run the application using either one of the above. :thumbsup:

=== Building and debugging code in Rider IDE

Before you build or debug code in `Rider` environment, you first have to configure artifactory to allow to download packages for `Common` which is a part of this repository:

- 1. Open `JetBrains Rider` and navigate to `File > Settings > NuGet > Sources`.
- 2. Click the `+` button to add a new package source.
- 3. In the `Add Package Source` window, provide Artifactory URL in the `https://nuget.pkg.github.com/evolutionary-architecture/index.json`, fill your Github Username and PAT.
- 4. Click `OK` to confirm the new package source.
- 5. Make sure your new package source is enabled and then click `OK` to close the `Settings` window.

You should now be able to restore and download the EvolutionaryArchitecture nuget packages from your Artifactory source within Rider.

[NOTE]
====
The provided instruction is primarily intended for JetBrains Rider. However, the procedure for adding a NuGet package source in alternative IDEs like Visual Studio is quite similar.

=== How to run Integration Tests?
Running integration tests for both the `Fitnet` Modular Monolith and `Fitness.Contracts` applications involves similar steps, as the testing setup for both projects.
To run the integration tests for project, you can use either the command:
[source,shell]
----
dotnet test
----
or the `IDE test Explorer`. 

These tests are written using `xUnit` and require `Docker` to be running as they use `test containers` package to run `PostgresSQL in a Docker` container during testing. 
Therefore, make sure to have `Docker` running before executing the integration tests.
