== Case

=== Overview

== How to Run?

=== Requirements
- .NET SDK
- PostgresSQL
- Docker

=== How to get .NET SDK?

To run the `Fitnet` application, you will need to have the recent `.NET SDK` installed on your computer.
Click link:https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download[here] 
to download it from the official Microsoft website.

=== Run locally

The `Fitnet` application requires `Docker` to run properly.

There are only 5 steps you need to start the application:

1. Create you own personal access token in Github (it is needed to be able to download our GH Packages for `Common`). Instruction how to do it you can find https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-create-a-personal-access-token-for-github-access[here]. Your PAT must have only one value of `read:packages`. Note the token somewhere as it won't be possible to read it again.
2. Go to `Contracts\Src` folder and edit `Dockerfile`. You must change `your_username` and `your_personal_access_token` to your own values (your GH username and PAT that you generated in Step 1). Repeat the step for `ModularMonolith\Src`.
3. Make sure that you go back to `root` directory of Chapter 3. 
4. Run `docker-compose build` to build the image of the application.
5. Run `docker-compose up` to start the application. In the meantime it will also start Postgres inside container.

The `Fitnet``modular monolith application runs on port `:8080`. Please navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser or http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html to explore the API.

The `Contracts` microservice runs on port `:8081`. Please navigate to http://localhost:8081 in your browser or http://localhost:8081/swagger/index.html to explore the API.

That's it! You should now be able to run the application using either one of the above. :thumbsup:

=== Building and debugging code in Rider IDE

Before you build or debug code in `Rider` environment, you first have to configure artifactory to allow to download packages for `Common` which is a part of this repository:

- 1. Open `JetBrains Rider` and navigate to `File > Settings > NuGet > Sources`.
- 2. Click the `+` button to add a new package source.
- 3. In the `Add Package Source` window, provide Artifactory URL in the `https://nuget.pkg.github.com/evolutionary-architecture/index.json`, fill your Github Username and PAT.
- 4. Click `OK` to confirm the new package source.
- 5. Make sure your new package source is enabled and then click `OK` to close the `Settings` window.

You should now be able to restore and download the EvolutionaryArchitecture nuget packages from your Artifactory source within Rider.

[NOTE]
====
The provided instruction is primarily intended for JetBrains Rider. However, the procedure for adding a NuGet package source in alternative IDEs like Visual Studio is quite similar.

=== How to run Integration Tests?
Running integration tests for both the `Fitnet` Modular Monolith and `Fitness.Contracts` applications involves similar steps, as the testing setup for both projects.
To run the integration tests for project, you can use either the command:
[source,shell]
----
dotnet test
----
or the `IDE test Explorer`. 

These tests are written using `xUnit` and require `Docker` to be running as they use `test containers` package to run `PostgresSQL in a Docker` container during testing. 
Therefore, make sure to have `Docker` running before executing the integration tests.
