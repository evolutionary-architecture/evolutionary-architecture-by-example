= 2. Use one project

Date: 2023-04-15

== Problem

We need to determine the most suitable solution structure for the initial phase of our project.

== Decision

We will employ a single project structure for production code, along with two separate test projects for integration and unit tests.

== Consequences

- The straightforward organization enables team members to quickly familiarize themselves with the codebase
- By simplifying the solution architecture at the outset, the team can prioritize delivering new features over addressing architectural concerns
- This approach allows us to make architectural pattern decisions for each module as needed, responding to real requirements instead of preemptively committing to specific patterns
- If not managed properly, the single project structure could become cluttered and disorganized, necessitating timely extraction into separate projects
- As the project grows, managing and maintaining a single project may become increasingly complex, potentially requiring a transition to a more modular structure
