= 6. Use Docker

Date: 2023-04-15

== Problem

We need a consistent way to manage dependencies, simplify application deployment, and ensure that our application runs consistently across different environments.

== Decision

We decided to use Docker, a containerization platform that enables us to package our application and its dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. Docker containers are self-contained, easily shareable, and provide a consistent environment for our application regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

== Consequences

- Containers encapsulate the application and its dependencies, making it easier to manage and maintain
- Docker ensures that our application runs consistently across different environments (development, testing, and production) by packaging it with its runtime environment
- Cntainers can be easily deployed to any environment that supports Docker, streamlining the deployment process and reducing potential deployment issues
- Sharing Docker images or Dockerfiles allows team members to quickly set up their development environment with the correct dependencies and configurations
- Developers may need time to learn Docker and its best practices
- Introducing Docker adds another layer of complexity to our application infrastructure, which could potentially result in new challenges and issues
