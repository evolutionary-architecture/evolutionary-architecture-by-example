= 25. Applying Tatical DDD Patterns in Contracts Module

Date: 2024-12-21

The business logic in our Contracts module has been expanding at a rapid pace, particularly with new requirements for contract annexes. 
The Contracts module requires strict data consistency as it represents a core business capability.
As the domain complexity increases, maintaining the module has become increasingly challenging.

== Problem
The Team has considered using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns like Aggregate Root, Entity, Value Object and more in near future.

== Decision
The team has decided to implement Tactical DDD patterns in the Contracts module, designating the binding contract as an Aggregate Root.

== Consequences
* **Maintainability**: More explicit domain invariants
* **Flexibility**: Easier to adapt to business changes due to clear aggregate boundaries
* **Accuracy**: More accurate representation of business concepts and relationships through explicit domain modeling
* **Consistency**: Improved data consistency through aggregate boundaries
* **Testability**: Easier to test domain logic in isolation
* **Clarity**: Clearer encapsulation of business rules
* **Complexity Management**: Reduced accidental complexity
* **Learning Curve**: Requires team members to learn DDD patterns
* **Time**: Initial development overhead and additional refactoring time
* **Careful Boundary Design**: Need for careful design of aggregate boundaries
* **Knowledge Transfer**: Need for knowledge-sharing sessions to align understanding of DDD patterns
* **Boilerplate**: Additional boilerplate code for value objects and entities
