= 25. Applying Tatical DDD Patterns in Contracts Module

Date: 2024-12-21

The business logic in our Contracts module has been expanding at a rapid pace, particularly with new requirements for contract annexes. 
The Contracts module requires strict data consistency as it represents a core business capability.
As the domain complexity increases, maintaining the module has become increasingly challenging.

== Problem
The Team has considered to use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns like Aggregate Root, Entity, Value Object and more in near future.

== Decision
The team has decided to implement Tactical DDD patterns in the Contracts module, designating the binding contract as an Aggregate Root.

== Consequences
* More accurate representation of business concepts and relationships through explicit domain modeling
* Improved data consistency through aggregate boundaries
* Clearer business rules encapsulation
* Easier to test domain logic in isolation
* More explicit domain invariants
* Reduced accidental complexity
* Learning curve for team members not familiar with DDD patterns
* Initial development overhead
* Need for careful aggregate boundary design
* Additional boilerplate code for value objects and entities
* Need for knowledge transfer sessions to align understanding of DDD patterns
* Additional development time for refactoring existing module
