= 10. Select integration style between passes and offers modules

Date: 2023-05-13

== Problem

In a certain business process, there is a requirement for communication between passes and offers.
For example, when a pass expires, an offer is proposed to the pass owner. 
There are several integration styles available for implementing this requirement, including synchronous and asynchronous calls.

== Decision

After careful consideration, messaging we chosen as the communication method for the requirement implementation, because business process did not require simultaneous state changes for pass expiration and proposing new offer.

Introducing a brief delay between pass expiration and offer processing we deemed beneficial for achieving high maintainability and modularity of the system.

== Consequences

- By using messaging, the coupling between the passes and offers modules can be reduced, resulting in a more modular system that is easier to maintain.
- Messaging can improve the maintainability of the system by allowing for flexible and independent updates to each module.
- However, messaging can introduce a delay between the pass expiry event and the generation of the new offer, due to the time required for message processing.
- Messaging also introduces additional points of failure, such as message processing failures, which need to be closely managed and monitored to ensure the system functions correctly.
