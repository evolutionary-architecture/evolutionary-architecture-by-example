= 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2023-04-15

== Problem

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project and store it as close to code as possible.

== Decision

We will use the concept of Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

== Consequences

- Every time new architecture decision comes in, it is required to add new architecture decision record
- Existing architecture decision records are immutable. Whenever there is a need to update old record, a new one is created
