= 12. Applying Clean Architecture approach to the Contracts module

Date: 2023-04-15

== Problem
The Contracts module within our application has been identified as having high technical and business complexity.
After domain and business analysis, we have recognized this module as a potential candidate to grow exponentially with a lot of business logic. 
In addition, the requirement for high testability has been highlighted. 
To address these challenges, we need to introduce an architecture style that can effectively handle the complexity of the module while promoting testability.

== Decision

After careful consideration, the team has decided to apply the "Clean Architecture" approach to the Contracts module. 
The Clean Architecture approach emphasizes the separation of concerns and the organization of code into distinct layers, promoting maintainability, testability.

=== Layers

- _API_: Responsible for handling external communication like http requests and providing interfaces for interacting with the Contracts module.
- _Application_: Contains use cases specific to the Contracts module.
- _Infrastructure_: Handles the technical aspects like persistence, configuration, external systems integrations or I/O operations.
- _Core_: Represents the heart of the Contracts module, containing the domain model and essential business logic.

The Clean Architecture approach enforces a strict separation of concerns and allows for clear dependencies between the layers.

== Consequences

Applying the Clean Architecture approach to the Contracts module will have the following consequences:

- Long-term reduced cognitive load by putting complexity responsibilities into isolated layers.
- Easier reasoning and modification of the Contracts module as the application evolves.
- Improved overall code quality through independent testing of each layer.
- Facilitated collaboration between team members due to well-defined responsibilities and interfaces.
- Enhanced encapsulation and control over visibility: The use of distinct layers allows developers to manipulate what is public and what remains internal implementation details within each layer.
This improves encapsulation and provides better control over the exposure of functionality and data, promoting information hiding and reducing the risk of unwanted dependencies or modifications from other layers.
- Higher learning curve for the development team, as it involves understanding and implementing the principles and patterns associated with this architectural style. 
- Additional effort required to create projects that will become layers.
