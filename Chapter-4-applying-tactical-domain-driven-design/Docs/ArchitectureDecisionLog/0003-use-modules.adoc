= 3. Use modules

Date: 2023-04-15

== Problem

We need to determine an effective approach for implementing the discovered subdomains in our solution while maintaining modularity and scalability.

== Decision

We decided that, in the initial phase of the project, we will assume that each subdomain corresponds to a single bounded context. Each bounded context will be represented by a module with its own namespace, such as:

- Passes
- Contracts
- Offers
- Reports

Modules cannot access other modules by reference, ensuring that each module remains independent and self-contained.

== Consequences

- Each module encapsulates its processes within its namespace, promoting separation of concerns
- This approach enhances modularity within our monolithic application, making it easier to manage and maintain
- If needed, extracting modules into separate projects or microservices becomes straightforward, as each module is represented by a single namespace
- Developers may need time to learn how to effectively modularize a monolithic application, particularly if they have no prior experience with this approach
- Managing multiple independent modules may increase complexity, particularly when it comes to communication and data sharing between modules
- If significant changes need to be made across the entire application, such as implementing a new API or database technology, this approach may result in slower development and deployment times, as changes will need to be made to each module individually
